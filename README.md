A collection of useful scripts for Scratch, written in [goboscript](https://github.com/aspizu/goboscript).

**WIP, subject to change!**

This repository is primarily for my own use. It may morph into a different form to suit my needs as goboscript develops.


### Usage

Assuming you have goboscript, use `goboscript build` to generate the `.sb3` file for inspection. If you are in the root path of this repository, use `goboscript build -i FOLDER_NAME` to target a specific folder. Each folder is a standalone project.
