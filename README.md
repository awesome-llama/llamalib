A collection of useful scripts for Scratch.
For use with [goboscript](https://github.com/aspizu/goboscript).

**WIP, subject to change!**
This repository may morph into a different form to suit my needs as goboscript develops.


### Usage

If goboscript is built (e.g. `cargo build --release`) and added to your system path, use `goboscript build` to generate the sb3 file for inspection. If you are in the root path of this repository, use `goboscript build -i FOLDER_NAME` to target a specific folder. Each folder functions as a standalone project.

If including these in your own goboscript projects, copy the relevant files or scripts over. As of writing, goboscript only uses relative file paths in `include`.
